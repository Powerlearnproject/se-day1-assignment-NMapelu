Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software  engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to development of software, its testing, deployment and maintenance. This approach enables creation of applications that power different aspects of modern life like communication


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages like Fortran
Establishment of Software Engineering in the 1960s
Development of Structured programming in the 1970s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements which is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design which is creating a highly detailed and high- level designs of the software architecture and interface
Deployment which is release of software to users


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases for example Design while Agile is an iterative and Incremental approach that focuses on flexibility. 
A banking system would need the Waterfall approach because the phases need to be distinct.
A mobile application on the other hand would use Agile due to customer or user updates being frequent


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Engineer- writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test  plans
Project Manager- Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Version Control systems  are used to track changes on source code and to coordinate work in a team situation eg. Github
Integrated Development Environments- are tools that eneble developers to write, debug and test code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Requirements may change which may lead to issues such as project delays
Tight deadlines may result in rushed development and compromised quality
Technical debt may increase maintenance costs


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing- Testing interactions between different components
System testing- Testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing- Testing software against user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting questions to get  the best possible responsesfrom AI models. It ensures the responses are detailed and relevant


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example: 
"Translate the following paragraph from French to English" may result in a better response than "Translate the following paragraph" because the prompts need to be clear specific and concise and the former is more specific and clear.
